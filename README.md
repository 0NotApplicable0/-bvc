# @bvc

# Intro
**TODO**: Write a short introduction on what BVC is.

# Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `yarn install`

# Future Use
Included the CRA runner in this package, in the future it may be removed but for now it is useful for testing 
and allows demo versions to be hosted independently of the main application.
